## Zebra: light-weight Offline Rendering Library 
[中文版README](./README.md)

### Zebra is a light-weight CG Offline Rendering Library, it originates from [Giraffe](https://www.github.com/UncP/Giraffe)

***

### Goal
* Implement all kinds of algorithms that solve rendering equation 
* Be adjusted properly to cooperate with [Elephant](https://www.github.com/UncP/Elephant) to carry out some experiments between Computer Graphics and Maching Learning.
